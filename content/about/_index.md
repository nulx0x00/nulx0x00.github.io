## nulx0x00:~$ whoami

I strip away security myths and build tools that operate at the low level—where real vulnerabilities live. No corporate gloss. No vendor FUD. Just raw technical truth.



### > What I Do

**Logic Research**: I dissect security concepts down to their OSI model foundations. If you've ever wondered why a security control *actually* works (or doesn't), that's where I operate.

**Tool Building**: I build offensive security tools in Python that solve real problems—not proof-of-concepts that die in GitHub repos. Currently focused on automated reconnaissance and data exposure analysis.

**Myth Stripping**: The security industry is full of marketing nonsense. I cut through it with technical analysis and empirical testing.
